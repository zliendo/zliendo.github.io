			 Triage is the assessment of the degree of urgency or acuity of a patient’s need for treatment. 
			 This process occurs whenever a patient enters in the emergency department.
			Prioritizing patients is a challenge for emergency departments all over the world, as departments need 
			to balance ever-changing patient needs, wait times, and hospital resources. 
			One significant issue is the inability to quickly distinguish significantly ill patients; 
			under-triaging these patients can delay time-sensitive treatment. With improved assessments of 
			ER patient risk and needs, emergency department (ED) nurses can realize improved triage assessments, 
			reducing the incidence of under-triaging.

			The ESI is a prioritization tool used by the majority of hospitals in the US, 
			assessing patient needs based on the severity of the patient’s condition and the anticipated number of 
			hospital resources needed to complete treatment. Under the ESI guidelines, patients receive a priority rating 
			from 1 to 5, with 1 being the most urgent.</p>		
			<p class="text-muted "> While the ESI usefully codifies the triage decision-making process, 
			over-triaging (assigning a lower ESI rating than optimal) and under-triaging remain problems. 
			Over-triaging means that patients who could wait are given higher priority than necessary, 
			possibly to the exclusion of more urgent cases. Under-triaging is potentially more serious, 
			as it implies that the condition of the individual needs more urgent attention than they are slated to receive.

			A natural outgrowth of this phenomenon is that the majority of patients are triaged to the middle category, ESI 3. 
			Overutilization of ESI 3 necessarily means that the other ESI categories are underutilized, 
			which is especially problematic for patients who need a more urgent category.</p>
				<p class="text-muted">
While the majority of patients did not experience a critical outcome (CO), we can see that the majority of CO patients were assigned to ESI 3.
The majority of ICU (Intensive Care Unit), OR (Operation Room), and cardiac catheterization patients were likewise assigned to the overutilized ESI 3. 
We found that 39.9% of patients who experienced a critical outcome were correctly assigned 
			to ESI 1 or ESI 2. Of those who died in the ED, 36% were assigned to ESI 3 or lower.</p>

            <p class="text-muted">We are using deep learning models trained on historical emergency department 
			records to jointly predict which patients are at high risk for critical outcomes, 
			and how many hospital resources each patient is expected to require. Based on these predictions, 
			we are able to recommend an ESI prioritization rating, and show the most important factors for this recommendation. 
			This rating relies on data that ER nurses already collect during triage, so this rating allows nurses to effectively 
			leverage the collective wisdom of thousands of emergency department cases, without disrupting the flow from triage assessment 
			to ESI assignment.</p>

            <p class="text-muted">As mentioned earlier, the biggest problem with the ESI is that it relies on the triage practitioner’s ability 
			to make accurate assessments as to the criticality of patients and the number of resources required for their care. 
			IDANN helps avoid miscategorization by providing an objective prediction of both of these parameters, thus allowing practitioners 
			to leverage case history in their decision making. As its name suggests, IDANN utilizes neural networks for its predictions 
			and pairs them with text embedding and an attention layer for interpretability.

            <p class="text-muted">While neural networks can have significant performance advantages compared to other models, 
			especially with large datasets, they suffer from being hard to understand by end-users. 
			IDANN addresses this by including an attention layer that ranks the importance of the predictors and the reason for visit (RFV) 
			embeddings. These rankings are then handed back to the requesting application for interpretation</p>

             <h4 class="service-heading">GUI vizualizations</h4>
            <p class="text-muted">One of the most important aspects of IDANN lies in its ability to explain its decision-making to the end-users. 
			In medicine, more so than other fields, it is important to ensure that the end-users are able to leverage the advantages provided 
			by this tool without having to make a leap of faith in trusting in it blindly.
			IDANN uses visualizations to provide the end-user with a concise, easy-to-follow explanation of the 
			decision-making process. These visualizations will help providers gain confidence in IDANN’s predictions and to take be able 
			to weigh the relative impact of different predictors on the patient

            </span>
            <h4 class="service-heading">API service</h4>
            <p class="text-muted">While an application like IDANN would be valuable on its own, one of its most prominent features is the 
			ability to embed it into other applications through the use of a REST API. This standard-based approach ensures that EMR 
			integrations are straightforward, and additional functionality and integrations can be pursued freely. 
			The use of FHIR helps address data portability and integrity concerns.
