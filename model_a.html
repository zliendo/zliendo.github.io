            Our modeling data is drawn from the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/ahcd/index.htm">National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care 
			Survey (NHAMCS)</a>, collected by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). 
			
			The data represented therein are comprised of de-identified health records from 1992-2015, 
			drawn from a national sample of visits to emergency departments, about 24K records a year.
			
			
			The data are part of routine ED data collection, so any ED could provide the same fields.
			
			
			An independent investigation of the dataset 
			by <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27133736">Dugas et al. (2016) </a>
			found the data to be complete and representative sample 
			of <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/emergency-department.htm">141.4 million visits per year</a>. 
			We based our exclusion categories on the categories outlined in Dugas et al.</p>

		   <p class="text-muted">
						 		
			 A key feature of the RFV codes was that they have a hierarchical coded arrangement; 
			 we transformed them into vectors in order to capture that hierarchy. 
			 We additionally translated the RFV codes into their text form, and created text embeddings in order to capture the semantic 
			 similarities between complaints that would be obvious to a nurse.	 </p>

		     <h5>Outcome Variables </h5>
		       <p class="text-muted">To calculate the Critical Outcome variable, we collapsed several patient outcomes into one binary variable: 
			any patient an outcome of death, admittance to ICU, OR, or cardiac catheterization, was considered to have experienced a 
			critical outcome. This represented about 7.1% of the total dataset, which we accounted for with weighted modeling techniques.</p>
			 <p class="text-muted">
			To calculate Resources, in alignment with the definition outline by the ESI, we calculated the total resources required for each patient,
			among diagnostic methods and procedures available in the dataset. Ultimately, this resulted in patients requiring 0, 1, or =2 resources.</p>
