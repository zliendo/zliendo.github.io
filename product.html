				<p class="text-muted">	IDANN Triage utilizes neural networks for its predictions and pairs 
				them with text embeddings and an attention layer for interpretability. 
				The model relies on data that ER nurses already collect during triage, 
				allowing nurses to leverage the collective wisdom of thousands 
				of emergency department cases, without disrupting the flow from triage assessment to ESI assignment. 
				This tool helps avoid triage miscategorization by using deep learning models to 
				jointly predict the risk of critical outcome and the resources needed for each patient.</p>

			   <h4 class="service-heading">Model Interpretability</h4>
				<p class="text-muted">Neural networks often outperform other types of models, especially with large datasets, 
				but can be hard for both data science experts and end-users to understand. 
				In medicine, it is especially important that end-users are able to take advantage 
				of machine learning tools in concert with their own expertise. 
				IDANN addresses this by including an attention layer, which ranks 
				the importance of the predictors and the embedded reasons for visit.

				confidence in IDANN's predictions, and weigh the relative impact of different predictors for each patient. 
				These visualizations are made possible by the inclusion of the attention layer.</p>
